## Comments
Regarding the last functionality (adding comment), although I've coded exactly as Tim did (I think), when I try adding a comment by pressing the simulator keyboard, the app gets terminated with the weird error that says "Thread 1: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=2, address=0x7ffeecabea20)". 

I'm doing troubleshootings and trying to resolve this error. TAs are helping me out as well.

I'll update the final version of the project when I get the error resolved.
